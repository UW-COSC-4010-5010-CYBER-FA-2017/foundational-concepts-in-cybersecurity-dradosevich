Abstraction


This one was a tad complicated. I choose to use the binary tree data structures as a way to show abstraction.
The good example prints out what a small tree may look like, which can be helpful for those who may not have seen one.
The poor example just explains them, not in an abstract way. This doesn't work well to show someone new an 
abstract level and what a binary tree may look like.
