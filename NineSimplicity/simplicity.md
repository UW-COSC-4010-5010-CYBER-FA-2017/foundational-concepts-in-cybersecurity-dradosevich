	This example is simple, it uses the power function to simply raise int a to int b.
	cout<<a << " raised to the "<< b << " is: " << pow(a,b)<<endl;

	This example is snot simple. Rther than using a built in function, it uses a for loop to make a simple calculation, which includes having an additional variable
	And opens up the code to the possibility of an offf by on error. 
	result=a;
	for(int i=0; i<b; i++)
	{
		result*=a;
	}
	cout<<a << " raised to the "<< b << " is: " << result<<endl;
