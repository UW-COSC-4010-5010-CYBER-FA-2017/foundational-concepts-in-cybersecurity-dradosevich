	This is a simple check to compare an inputted number and a predeclared number (could be anything but I set zero)
	The key here is the check value is previously delcared. 
	int checkValue =0;

*
	This program is almost the same  as the good example. However, checksum is not declared so it uses what ever was previously in that memory location. Which is extremely poor 
	int checkValue;
