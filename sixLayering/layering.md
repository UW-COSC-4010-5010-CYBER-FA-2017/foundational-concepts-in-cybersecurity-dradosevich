Ten principles of Cyber security.
Layering

For this example a peice of information was kept below four password checks to access.
This created layers of security that would hep prevent access to the data, if the passwords ahd been non trivial.
In the poor example there were no layers to protect the data, and it was easily accesible (granted I did just print it... but still),
without the layers it is a lot easier for attackers to access the data.
