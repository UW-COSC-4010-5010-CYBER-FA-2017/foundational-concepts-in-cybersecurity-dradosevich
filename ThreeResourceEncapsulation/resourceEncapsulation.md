Resource Encapsulation

/*
	Why is this an example of dresource encapsulation? The variables are are within a class and require specific methods to gain access to. 
	class Example
{
	private: int highlyImportantValue;
	public: int forProgrammerEyesOnly()
	{
		return highlyImportantValue;
	}

};
*/
/*
	This is a poor demonstration as resource encapsulation as the variable is not stored in anything, it is just floating in the main class.
	int highlyImportantValue;
