/*
	This is a good example of modularity do to the fact that it uses a function. The same function can be used in multiple places, rather than haveing to retype
	The same code in every place used.
	int mySum(int a, int b)
{
		return a+b;
}
*/
/*
	This is a poor example for modularity as it does not use a function, so everytime a similar peice of code is used it must
	be retyped.
